# Modulation_Transfer_Function
The project implemented a method for estimating the Edge Response, Point Spread, and Modulation Transfer function of computed tomography (CT) system of a cylindrical object. The important features are: 
- Use of Interpolation Techniques like Pixel Binning and Polynomial Fitting 
- Processing of images using OpenCV library 
- Hybrid Implementation: CPU and GPU together  

Language - C++ 

Framework - OpenCL
